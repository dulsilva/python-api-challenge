# python-api-challenge

Background: 

Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?


Resources: 
My peers for feedback on retrieveing data from API. My issue was not solved this way and kept me from completeing the challenge. Stack Overflow helped me solve other errors I was finding due to a lack of installing certain programs.
